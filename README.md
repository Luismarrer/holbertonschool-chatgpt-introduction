## Python Debugging and Documentation with ChatGPT

This repository showcases a collection of tasks where ChatGPT assists in debugging Python scripts and documenting code for various applications. The project includes debugging and documenting Python scripts, enhancing HTML/JavaScript functionalities, and developing interactive Python applications like a checkbook manager and a Tic Tac Toe game.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Debugging and Documentation**: Each script, whether it's Python, HTML, or JavaScript, has been debugged and documented to enhance functionality and clarity.
- **Interactive Applications**: From financial management to games, these scripts provide user engagement through the command line and web interfaces.
- **Error Handling and Input Validation**: Scripts include robust error handling and input validation to ensure reliable application performance.

### Prerequisites

To run the Python scripts, you will need Python 3.x installed on your computer. For the HTML/JavaScript, any modern web browser will suffice. You can verify your Python version and install it if necessary by visiting [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Included Scripts and How to Use Them

1. **Factorial Calculator (Recursive and Iterative)**
   - Calculates the factorial of a given number using both recursive and iterative approaches.
   - Run `python3 factorial_recursive.py` or `python3 factorial.py` with an integer argument to see its factorial.

2. **Checkbook Manager**
   - Manages financial transactions allowing deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
   - Run `python3 checkbook.py` and follow the interactive prompts.

3. **Tic Tac Toe Game**
   - A classic game implemented in Python where two players can play Tic Tac Toe via the terminal.
   - Run `python3 tic.py` and use the row and column inputs to play.

4. **Argument Printer**
   - A script that prints command line arguments passed to it, excluding the script name.
   - Run `python3 print_arguments.py` followed by any arguments.

5. **Dynamic Background Color Changer (HTML/JavaScript)**
   - An HTML page that allows users to change the background color by clicking a button.
   - Open `change_background.html` in a browser and click the button to change the background color.

6. **Minesweeper Game**
   - A Python implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.
   - Run `python3 mines.py` and follow the on-screen instructions to play.

### Running the Scripts

- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Luismarrer/holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction.git
